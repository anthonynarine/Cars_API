# Cars_API
My first API with Django and  REST. 

Project setup:

1. create virtual enviroment.
    pipenv install

2. access shell
    pipenv shell

3. set python interpreter.
    pipenv --venv
    copy path
    ctrl + p 
    search Python select interpreter
    past path into "Enter interpreter paht"

4. install Django
    pipenv install django

5. install mysqlconnector or mysqlclient (they work the same)
    pipenv install mysqlclient

6. install RESTframework
    pipenv install djangorestframework

once this is pushed to github. if it's cloned down all installed packages will 
automatically be installed.



Creating Django project file.
1. django-admin

Generating project
2. django-admin startproject <project name> .
        a space and . is needed after the project name 
        so that the files can be placed in the name of 
        the project folder.

        it's good practice to use project as the end
        of your projcet name so to not confuse files.
